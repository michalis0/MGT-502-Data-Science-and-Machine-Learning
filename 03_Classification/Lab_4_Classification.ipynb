        "We now move from regression to another important branch of machine learning: classification. As the name indicates, the idea is to classify items of a dataset into **predefined classes** for which labelled data is already available. Therefore, classification is an instance of supervised machine learning.\n",

        "Classification is similar to regression, but instead of predicting a continuous target, classification algorithms attempt to apply a discrete number of labels or classes to each observation.\n",

        "While in a regression the targets are generally numerical and continuous-valued, oftentimes the targets in classification are categorical.  \n",
        "\n",
        "However, classification can be applied in settings where the target is numerical. For example, we might want to predict whether the unemployment rate for a country will be low, medium, or high, but do not care about the actual number. In such cases, determining the \"optimal\" way to categorize our target variable might require some creativity, and it is important to properly justify our assumptions.\n",

        "Finally, note that many problems can be written either as classification or regression. Hence, many ML algorithms have variants that perform regression or classification tasks."

Newton's method generally converges faster than Gradient Descent. However, Newton's method is computationally-expensive and the Hessian might not even exist.
